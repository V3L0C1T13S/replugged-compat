# Replugged compatibility for Rikka
A plugin that introduces Replugged/Powercord compatibility to Rikka. Instead of doing manual library by library translation, it loads up Replugged in such a way that it won't conflict with Rikka, and can run alongside any other plugins and compatibility layers you have installed (including vz-compat).
## SETUP
To setup Replugged compat, you'll need to manually clone Replugged/Powercord into storage/replugged-compat. Follow the setup guide for your platform, but don't run `npm run plug` otherwise you'll install Replugged over Rikka.
